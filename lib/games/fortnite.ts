  longDescription: `Fortnite is a free-to-play battle royale game developed and published by Epic Games. The game features several game modes, with the most popular being Fortnite Battle Royale, where up to 100 players fight to be the last person or team standing.

Players are dropped onto an island and must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and attack other players. They must also avoid being caught outside of a shrinking safe zone, which damages the player's health.

The building mechanic sets Fortnite apart from other battle royale games. Players can harvest materials (wood, brick, and metal) to build walls, floors, stairs, and roofs to create defensive structures or reach higher ground.

The game is known for its frequent updates, seasonal events, and collaborations with popular franchises and celebrities. Each new season brings map changes, new items, and a new Battle Pass with cosmetic rewards.

Fortnite also includes other game modes such as:
- Creative mode, where players can build their own islands
- Save the World, a cooperative player-versus-environment mode
- Various limited-time modes that change the standard gameplay`,
