  longDescription: `Assassin's Creed Valhalla is an action role-playing video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the twelfth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series.

Set in 873 AD, the game recounts a fictional story during the Viking invasion of Britain. The player controls Eivor, a Viking raider who becomes embroiled in the conflict between the Brotherhood of Assassins and the Templar Order.

The game features elements from both action-adventure and role-playing games, and supports a vast open world environment that includes the regions of Norway, England, and mythological realms like Asgard and Jotunheim. Players can use a variety of weapons and engage in both melee combat and stealth to defeat enemies.

The game also includes activities such as hunting, fishing, and drinking games, as well as a settlement-building feature where players can develop and customize their own Viking settlement.`,
