  shortDescription:
    "An epic tale of life in America's unforgiving heartland, featuring a vast and atmospheric world to explore.",
  longDescription: `Red Dead Redemption 2 is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games. The game is the third entry in the Red Dead series and is a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption.

Set in 1899 in a fictionalized representation of the Western, Midwestern, and Southern United States, the story follows outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang. Arthur must deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries.

The game features both single-player and online multiplayer components, with the latter released under Red Dead Online. The gameplay focuses on an honor system, which influences how NPCs react to Arthur based on his actions. The player can freely roam the interactive open world, which features diverse landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife.

Red Dead Redemption 2 was widely anticipated and received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its story, characters, open world, and considerable level of detail. It had the second-biggest launch in the history of entertainment, generating $725 million in sales from its opening weekend and shipping over 23 million copies in retail.`,
