  shortDescription:
    "A massively multiplayer party game with up to 60 players online in a free-for-all struggle through round after round of escalating chaos.",
  longDescription: `Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a platform battle royale game developed by Mediatonic and published by Devolver Digital. The game draws inspiration from game shows like Takeshi's Castle, It's a Knockout and Wipeout, and playground games like tag and British bulldog.

Up to 60 players control jellybean-like creatures and compete against each other in a series of randomly selected mini-games, such as obstacle courses or tag. Players are eliminated as the rounds progress until, eventually, the last remaining player is crowned the winner.

The game uses a physics-based gameplay system that can sometimes lead to hilarious and unpredictable situations. Players can grab, jump, dive, and more to navigate the various challenges.

Fall Guys was initially released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in August 2020. Following Mediatonic's acquisition by Epic Games, the game adopted a free-to-play model for all platforms in June 2022, and was also released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its chaotic gameplay, visual appearance, and family-friendly nature. It has won and been nominated for numerous industry awards and has attracted millions of players.`,
