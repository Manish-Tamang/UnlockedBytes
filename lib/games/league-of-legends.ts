  shortDescription:
    "A team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the other's base.",
  longDescription: `League of Legends (LoL) is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre.

In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion," with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus," a large structure located within.

League of Legends has received generally positive reviews, with critics highlighting its accessibility, character designs, and production value. The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews trending positively. The game's setting, Runeterra, has expanded into other media, such as comic books and a Netflix animated series, Arcane.

The game is free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. It is one of the highest-grossing games of all time, with reported revenues of over $1.75 billion in 2020.`,
