  shortDescription:
    "A party game of teamwork and betrayal where players attempt to prepare their spaceship for departure, but beware as one or more random players among the crew are Impostors.",
  longDescription: `Among Us is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio Innersloth. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing.

The game takes place in a space-themed setting where players each take on one of two roles: most are Crewmates, but a predetermined number are Impostors whose goal is to sabotage the ship and kill the Crewmates without being identified.

Crewmates can win by completing all tasks or discovering and voting out all of the Impostors. The Impostors can win by killing enough Crewmates or by sabotaging a critical system on the map.

While initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received an influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. In response to the game's popularity, a sequel was announced in 2020, but was canceled as the team shifted focus to improving the original game.

Among Us has been praised for its simplicity and accessibility, as well as its social deduction gameplay that encourages communication and deception. It has been compared to other social deduction games like Werewolf and Secret Hitler.`,
