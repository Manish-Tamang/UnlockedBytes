  longDescription: `FIFA 23 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts. It is the 30th and final installment in the FIFA series that is developed by EA Sports, and the final installment under the FIFA banner.

The game features both men's and women's football, with the men's FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and the women's FIFA World Cup Australia/New Zealand 2023 being available as post-launch updates at no additional cost.

FIFA 23 introduces HyperMotion2 Technology, which uses machine learning to create more realistic player movements. The game also features cross-play between the same platform families, allowing players on PlayStation 5 to play with or against players on Xbox Series X/S, for example.

The game includes various game modes, such as Career Mode, where players can manage a club or play as a single player throughout their career; Ultimate Team, where players can build their dream squad and compete online; and VOLTA Football, a street football mode.

FIFA 23 also features over 30 licensed leagues, over 700 clubs, and over 19,000 players, making it one of the most comprehensive football games in terms of licensing.`,
