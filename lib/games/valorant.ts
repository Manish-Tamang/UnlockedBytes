  shortDescription: "A 5v5 character-based tactical shooter where precise gunplay meets unique agent abilities.",
  longDescription: `Valorant is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games. The game was first teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, and was released for Microsoft Windows on June 2, 2020.

The game operates on an economy-round, objective-based, first-to-13 competitive format where you select a unique agent to play for the entirety of the match. The game puts two teams of five players against each other, with each player selecting from a roster of characters called "agents," each with their own unique abilities.

Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed.

The game has a variety of weapons including sidearms, submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to increase accuracy.

Valorant draws inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.`,
